# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a booking application for Jamboree 2026, built with Gleam and PostgreSQL. It enables participants to book various activities during the event.

## Essential Commands

### Development
```sh
gleam run                          # Run the web server (starts on port 8000)
gleam test                         # Run tests
gleam run -m squirrel              # Regenerate Gleam modules from SQL (run after modifying SQL files)
```

### Database Setup
```sh
# Set database URL
export DATABASE_URL="postgres://postgres@localhost:5432/j26booking"

# Run migrations
gleam run -m cigogne last

# Seed database with example activities
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -f priv/seeding/activities.sql
```

## Architecture

### Tech Stack
- **Web Framework**: Mist + Wisp (Gleam web server)
- **Frontend**: Lustre (SSR) + HTMX + TailwindCSS
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Squirrel (type-safe queries) and Cigogne (migrations)

### Application Structure

The app uses a supervised architecture with two main components:
1. **Database pool** (`pog.supervised`): Connection pool to PostgreSQL
2. **Web server** (`wisp_mist.supervised`): HTTP server on port 8000

Both are managed by a RestForOne supervisor in `src/j26booking.gleam:36-39`.

### Key Modules

- **`src/j26booking.gleam`**: Entry point, sets up supervision tree and database connection
- **`src/j26booking/router.gleam`**: Request routing and handlers
- **`src/j26booking/web.gleam`**: Middleware configuration and Context type
- **`src/j26booking/components.gleam`**: Lustre components for SSR
- **`src/j26booking/data.gleam`**: Data transformation utilities
- **`src/j26booking/sql.gleam`**: Generated by Squirrel (DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY)

### Database Workflow

1. **Schema changes**: Add SQL files to `priv/migrations/`
2. **Queries**: Add `.sql` files to `src/j26booking/sql/`
3. **Regenerate**: Run `gleam run -m squirrel` to generate type-safe Gleam code in `src/j26booking/sql.gleam`
4. **Apply migrations**: Run `gleam run -m cigogne last`

The database connection is hardcoded to `localhost:5432` with database name `j26booking` and user `postgres` (no password).

### Request Flow

```
Request → web.middleware → router.handle_request → handler functions
                ↓
        (static files, logging, crash recovery)
```

Routes are defined in `src/j26booking/router.gleam:12-17`:
- `/` → redirects to `/index.html`
- `/activities` → lists all activities from database
- `/book/:id` → booking endpoint (placeholder)

### Database Schema (MVP)

Core tables:
- **user**: id, role (organizer/booker/admin)
- **activity**: id, title, description, max_attendees, start_time, end_time
- **booking**: id, user_id, activity_id, group, responsible, phone_number, participant_count
- **activity_user**: many-to-many between activities and organizers
