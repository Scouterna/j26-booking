-- Creates a location that has coordinates and returns it. opening_hours is
-- sent as JSON text; the parameter type is inferred as jsonb from the target
-- column. Squirrel cannot generate optional query parameters, so a location
-- without coordinates is created by the _without_coordinates variant instead.
